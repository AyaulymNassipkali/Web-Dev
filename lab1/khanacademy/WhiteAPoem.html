    <h1>Your Best</h1>
    <p>if ypu always try to your best<br>
        Then you will never have to wonder<br>
        About what you could have done<br>
        If you'd summoned all yout thunder.<br>
        <h2>And if your best</h2>
        Was not as good<br>
        As you hoped it would be,<br>
        You still could say,<br>
        "I gave today <br>
        All that I had in me".
